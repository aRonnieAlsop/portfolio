>>The personal blog application is built using React on the frontend and SQLite for the backend. The blog content, including rich HTML (such as text, images, and videos), is stored directly in the SQLite database for easy management and retrieval.

>>To ensure security, embedded HTML content is only used in blog posts because the site is curated by a single author (the site owner), who has full control over the content. This eliminates the risk of malicious content typically associated with user-generated input, making the platform safe while allowing for flexibility in presenting rich media and styled content.
